# A WASM Demo Project 

Please open the `demo.html` in a Live Server, or there would be an error caused by CORS policy. I wrote and tested the web page on `vscode` with `Live Server` plugin.

Open the console could see two values returned. The first one is directly printed by the log function called in `add.wasm`, and the latter one is obtained from the `add` function return value.
